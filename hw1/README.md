### Mute / Unmute

### RWD

####  height/width in percentage(%)

Setting height/width in percentage allows the elements to change their size along with the window.

#### Media Queries

Using `@media` rule to apply different sizes of Google material icons and buttons when the maximum width of the window changes.

#### min-width

When the width or height of the window is shrinked to a certain point, `min-width` prevents the elements from shrinking.
